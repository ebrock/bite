# bite

**bite** is a frontend React app which displays restaurant information, provided by the free [Zomato](https://www.zomato.com/) API.

### Workflow

1. Enter a city.
2. Select city from suggested locations.
3. Select cuisines.
4. Tap or click a result to get information.

The app has some limitations in its current state. For example, sometimes results are returned from out-of-town locations since the API calls do not limit search results by distance. The API also relies on user input for reviews, so restaurants with low volume may not have properly reflected ratings. There are some clear out-of-the-box issues that I am looking forward to tackling.

## Roadmap

This project has been a very fun learning experience working with APIs and I want to use it as a launching point to learn and improve in other areas of web development. For example: creating a backend for handling API calls (perhaps AWS Lambda), adding Google Places API for Maps, improving the UI/UX and search results formatting, and other QOL improvements.

The roadmap can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ebrock/bite/projects) or in the Projects section of the repo.
